## 1. What is Agentic AI?

### 1.1 Definition

**Agentic AI** is a type of AI system that can:
- Accept a task and goal from a user
- Work autonomously toward completion with minimal human guidance
- Plan, execute actions, and adapt to changes
- Seek help only when necessary

### 1.2 Agentic AI vs. Generative AI

| Aspect | Generative AI | Agentic AI |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Behavior** | Reactive | Proactive |
| **User Involvement** | Guides every step | Minimal intervention |
| **Planning** | User-driven | Self-driven |
| **Example** | ChatGPT answering individual questions | Complete task automation |

### 1.3 Illustrative Example: Travel Planning

**With Generative AI (Reactive Approach)**:
```
User: "Best way to reach Goa on 15th?"
Bot: [Answers only that question]
User: "Which hotels to stay?"
Bot: [Answers only that question]
User: "What about local transportation?"
Bot: [Answers only that question]
```
*User drives each step of the process*

**With Agentic AI (Proactive Approach)**:
```
User: "I want to travel to Goa from [date] to [date]"
Agent automatically:
  ✓ Finds best transportation options
  ✓ Recommends hotels
  ✓ Creates complete itinerary
  ✓ Handles all logistics proactively
```
*Agent takes ownership of the entire goal*

## 3. Six Key Characteristics

### 3.1 Autonomy

**Definition**: Ability to make decisions and take actions independently to achieve a goal without step-by-step human instructions.

#### Levels of Autonomy

1. **Execution Autonomy**
   - Executes plan steps automatically
   - Example: Posting job descriptions on platforms

2. **Decision-Making Autonomy**
   - Makes choices independently
   - Example: Shortlisting candidates based on criteria

3. **Tool Usage Autonomy**
   - Decides which tools to use and when
   - Example: Choosing resume parser vs. manual review

#### Controlling Autonomy (Critical for Safety)

**1. Define Scope/Permissions**
```
Allowed:
  ✓ Screen resumes automatically
  ✓ Draft emails
  ✓ Schedule meetings

Requires Approval:
  ⚠ Rejecting candidates
  ⚠ Sending offer letters
  ⚠ Budget expenditures
```

**2. Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints**
- Insert approval gates for critical actions
- Example: Must get permission before posting JD

**3. Override Controls**
- Allow users to stop, pause, or modify agent behavior
- Example: Command "Pause hiring" stops all activities immediately

**4. Guard Rails and Policies**
Hard rules and ethical boundaries:
```
Never:
  ✗ Schedule interviews on weekends
  ✗ Use informal language in communications
  ✗ Spend beyond budget limit
  ✗ Make biased decisions based on protected characteristics
```

#### Risks of Uncontrolled Autonomy
- ⚠ Rolling out incorrect offers with wrong salary/terms
- ⚠ Biased hiring based on nationality, age, or other factors
- ⚠ Unlimited spending on ads without permission
- ⚠ Violating company policies or legal requirements

---

### 3.2 Goal-Oriented

**Definition**: System operates with a persistent objective and continuously directs all actions toward achieving that objective.

#### Key Points
- All planning and execution directed toward the goal
- Goal acts as a compass for autonomous functioning
- Without a clear goal, the system cannot function properly

#### Types of Goals

**1. Independent Goals**
```
Simple: "Hire a backend engineer"
```

**2. Goals with Constraints**
```
Main Goal: "Hire a backend engineer"
Constraints:
  - Location: India
  - Work Mode: Remote
  - Budget: $X
  - Experience: 2-4 years
  - Tech Stack: Python, Django, AWS
```

#### Goal Storage in Memory (Conceptual)
```json
{
  "main_goal": "Hire a backend engineer",
  "constraints": {
    "experience": "2-4 years",
    "remote": true,
    "tech_stack": ["Python", "Django", "AWS"],
    "location": "India",
    "budget": "$X"
  },
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "progress": {
    "jd_created": true,
    "posted_on": ["LinkedIn", "Naukri"],
    "applications_received": 8,
    "interviews_scheduled": 2,
    "hired": false,
    "onboarded": false
  }
}
```

#### Goal Flexibility
- Goals can be modified mid-execution
- Example: Change from "hire backend engineer" to "find freelancer for project"
- System re-plans and adjusts execution accordingly

---

### 3.3 Planning

**Definition**: Agent's ability to break down high-level goals into structured sequences of actions and sub-goals.

> **Critical Note**: Planning is one of THE most important characteristics of Agentic AI

#### The Planning-Execution Loop
```
Goal → Planning → Execution → Evaluation → Re-planning (if needed) → Execution...
```

#### Three-Step Planning Process

**Step 1: Generate Multiple Candidate Plans**

Planning is a search problem: Initial State → Final State

Example for hiring:
```
Plan A: Job Portal Strategy
  - Post on LinkedIn, Naukri, AngelList
  - Promote posts with ads
  - Monitor and screen applications

Plan B: Alternative Strategy
  - Use internal referrals
  - Engage hiring agency
  - Leverage professional networks
```

**Step 2: Evaluate Plans**

Evaluation criteria:

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Efficiency** | Which plan executes faster? |
| **Tool Availability** | Do we have required tools/APIs? |
| **Cost** | Which fits budget constraints? |
| **Risk** | Which has lower failure probability? |
| **Alignment** | Which better matches requirements? |

**Step 3: Select Best Plan**

Selection methods:
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Ask supervisor for input
- **Pre-programmed policy**: Automated decision based on rules
- **Hybrid approach**: Combination of both

#### Iterative Nature of Planning
```
Plan → Execute → Encounter Issue → Re-plan → Execute → ...
```

Example:
```
Initial Plan: Post on job portals
↓
Execute: Posted, but low applications
↓
Re-plan: Change job title, add ads
↓
Execute: Increased applications
↓
Continue...
```

### 3.4 Perception

**Definition**: Agent's ability to understand and interpret inputs from its environment.

#### What Perception Involves
- Understanding user requests
- Interpreting data from tools
- Processing feedback
- Recognizing context and nuances

#### Example in HR Recruiter Context
```
Input: "Find me a backend engineer"
Perception Process:
  1. Understand role type (backend engineer)
  2. Infer typical requirements
  3. Recognize implicit constraints
  4. Contextualize within company needs
```

---

### 3.5 Adaptability

**Definition**: Ability to adjust plans and actions based on changing circumstances or new information.

#### Examples from HR Recruiter

**Scenario 1: Low Applications**
```
Observation: Only 3 applications in 5 days
Adaptation: 
  - Change job title
  - Expand posting platforms
  - Increase promotion budget
```

**Scenario 2: Exceptional Candidate**
```
Observation: Candidate doesn't meet strict criteria but has exceptional skills
Adaptation:
  - Escalate to human supervisor
  - Request exception review
  - Adjust screening criteria if approved
```

---

### 3.6 Learning (Implicit)

**Definition**: Ability to improve performance over time based on experience and feedback.

#### Types of Learning
- Learning from successful hires
- Learning from failed strategies
- Learning user preferences
- Learning optimal timing and approaches

---

## 4. Five Core Components

### 4.1 Brain (Decision-Making & Reasoning)

**Function**: Central intelligence that makes decisions and reasons about actions

#### Sub-components
- **Planner**: Creates multiple candidate plans
- **Evaluator**: Assesses and selects best plans
- **Reasoner**: Makes logical inferences
- **Decision-maker**: Chooses actions based on context

#### Example in Action
```
Situation: 2 strong candidates, 1 interview slot available
Brain Process:
  1. Evaluate both candidates
  2. Consider scheduling constraints
  3. Decide: Schedule both in sequence or parallel
  4. Optimize for time and quality
```

---

### 4.2 Perception (Understanding Inputs)

**Function**: Interprets and understands inputs from environment

#### Input Types
- User messages and commands
- Tool outputs and responses
- Environmental signals
- Feedback and corrections

#### Processing Pipeline
```
Raw Input → Parsing → Understanding → Contextualization → Action
```

---

### 4.3 Tools (Action Execution)

**Analogy**: Tools are like hands and legs for AI agents

#### Types of Tools

**1. RAG-based Knowledge Base**
```
Function: Retrieve factual and domain-specific information
Example: Access company documents, policies, templates
Purpose: Ground responses in actual data
```

**2. API Integrations**
```
Examples:
  - LinkedIn API (job posting)
  - Naukri API (job posting)
  - Calendar API (scheduling)
  - Email API (communications)
```

**3. Specialized Tools**
```
Examples:
  - Resume parser
  - Candidate screening algorithms
  - Interview question generators
  - Offer letter templates
```

#### Tool Selection
- Agent autonomously decides which tool to use
- Based on current task and context
- Optimizes for efficiency and accuracy

---

### 4.4 Memory (Context & State Management)

**Importance**: Critical for maintaining context and tracking progress

#### A. Short-term Memory

**Stores**:
- Current session messages
- User messages in ongoing conversation
- Tool calls made during session
- Immediate decisions
- Current context

**Example**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "12345",
  "messages": [
    {"user": "Hire backend engineer"},
    {"agent": "Creating job description..."},
    {"tool": "JD created successfully"}
  ],
  "current_task": "Posting on LinkedIn",
  "context": "Hiring process - Step 2"
}
```

#### B. Long-term Memory

**Stores**:
- High-level goals
- Past interactions (across sessions)
- User preferences
- Historical decisions
- Learning from past experiences

**Example**:
```json
{
  "user_preferences": {
    "preferred_platforms": ["LinkedIn", "Naukri"],
    "typical_budget": "$X",
    "hiring_patterns": "Prefers IIT/NIT candidates"
  },
  "past_hires": [
    {"role": "Backend Engineer", "success": true, "source": "LinkedIn"},
    {"role": "Frontend Engineer", "success": true, "source": "Referral"}
  ]
}
```

#### C. State Tracking

**Monitors**:
- Progress: How much work completed
- Remaining tasks
- Overall system state
- Goal achievement status

**Example**:
```json
{
  "goal": "Hire backend engineer",
  "progress": {
    "jd_created": ✓,
    "posted": ✓,
    "applications": 8,
    "screened": 8,
    "interviews_scheduled": 2,
    "offers_sent": 0,
    "hired": ✗
  },
  "completion_percentage": 60
}
```

---

### 4.5 Supervisor (Human-AI Collaboration)

**Definition**: Bridge between agent and human for collaborative work

**Importance**: "Last but not least" - enables Human-in-the-Loop concept

#### Use Cases

**1. Approval for High-Risk Actions**

Examples:
```
High-Risk Actions Requiring Approval:
  ⚠ Sending offer letters to candidates
  ⚠ Running paid LinkedIn ads
  ⚠ Rejecting candidates
  ⚠ Making budget commitments
```

Process:
```
Agent → Identifies high-risk action
      → Notifies supervisor
      → Waits for permission
      → Executes only after approval
```

**2. Enforcing Guard Rails**

Implements system constraints:
```
Guard Rails:
  - Budget limits
  - Policy compliance
  - Ethical boundaries
  - Legal requirements
```

**3. Handling Edge Cases**

**Practical Example**:
```
Guard Rail: "Only hire candidates from IITs and NITs"

Edge Case Scenario:
  - Agent finds candidate NOT from IIT/NIT
  - BUT resume is exceptionally good
  
Supervisor Action:
  1. Alerts human to review this particular resume
  2. Escalates decision to human judgment
  3. Allows flexibility within constraints
  4. Learns from human decision for future
```

**4. Escalations**

When to escalate:
- Exceptional situations requiring human judgment
- Conflicts between rules and optimal outcomes
- Ambiguous scenarios
- Novel situations not covered by training
